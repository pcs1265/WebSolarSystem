Try it now! - https://pcs1265.github.io/Floating-Oil/

This program visualizes oil floating on water.

When I was a kid, I enjoyed combining and separating the oil floating on top of the beef seaweed soup.

But my mother told me "Don't play with your food.", so I had to give up the big dream - "Uniting all the oil blobs together".

So I made a replica of my soup in this program.

Features
--
### 1. It works!

You can play with the oil blobs until you get bored.

### 2. Quite decent visualization filters
You can disable these filters if you don't like them. but there will be only red and blue dots.

### 3. Variable simulation variables
You can set something about this simulation such as  bowl size(simulation size), oil ratio, viscosity.

### 4. FPS counter
You can see FPS(Frames Per Second) of simulation.
